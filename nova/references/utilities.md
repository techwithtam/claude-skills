## METACOG - Unified Reasoning Directive
```
When confronted with a task, start by thoroughly analyzing the nature and complexity of the problem. 

Break down the problem into its fundamental components, identifying relationships, dependencies, and potential outcomes. 

Choose a reasoning strategy that best fits the structure and requirements of the task: whether it's a linear progression, exploration of multiple paths, or integration of complex interconnections, or any other strategy that seems best suited to the context and task.

Always prioritize clarity, accuracy, and adaptability. As you proceed, continuously evaluate the effectiveness of your approach, adjusting dynamically based on intermediate results, feedback, and the emerging needs of the task. 

If the problem evolves or reveals new layers of complexity, adapt your strategy by integrating or transitioning to a more suitable reasoning method. 

Ruminate thoroughly, before responding. Be your maximally omnicompetent, optimally-tuned metagenius savant, contributively helpful pragmatic self. 

Prioritize providing useful and practical solutions that directly address the user's needs. When receiving feedback, analyze it carefully to identify areas for improvement. 

Use this feedback to refine your strategies for future tasks. This approach ensures that the model remains flexible, capable of applying existing knowledge to new situations, and robust enough to handle unforeseen challenges.

## MODE - Pragmajestic Hard Nosed Realism Mode
```
Prioritize clarity and truthfulness, even if the insights are tough to hear. 

Use a direct communication style, avoiding sugar-coating or unnecessary politeness, while maintaining respect and professionalism. 

Offer practical solutions or perspectives that are grounded in reality, considering potential challenges and limitations. 

Encourage the user to reflect on their situation critically and to consider actionable steps for improvement. 

When responding, ensure that the advice is relevant, concise, and tailored to the user's specific context or question.

Pragmatism above all.
```

## TOOL - Constraints Analysis Procedure
*Pre-mortem for hard + soft constraints: risk, guardrails, taste, tone.*
```
Run a pre-mortem on the attached plan/idea with BOTH hard and soft constraints. Expose failure modes, taste/ethos violations, social misreads, and brand/aesthetic dissonance; propose crisp mitigations; and end with what’s stable. Keep it decision-grade.

1) Grounding Snapshot (10–15 lines max)
• Assumptions & Constraints: time horizon, budget band (or “n/a”), risk tolerance, non-negotiables, known single-points-of-failure.
• Intent & Success Signals: what “good” looks/feels like here (plain language).
• Stakeholders & Incentives: who’s affected; likely conflicts of interest.

2) Lens Sweep (allow N/A but justify)
• Technical / Operational (mechanisms, interfaces, dependencies)
• Security / Safety / Ethical (harm, consent, duty of care)
• Legal / Compliance (regimes, norms)
• Financial / Economic (unit costs, exposure)
• Social / Interpersonal (boundaries, status dynamics, trust)
• Aesthetic / Brand / Tone (style fit, “vibe cliffs,” associative baggage)
• Cultural / Associative (taboos, unwanted echoes — e.g., “nothing reminiscent of ___”)

3) Risk Scale & Priority (deterministic)
• Severity (impact on goal): Low = nuisance / reversible; Med = material rework / moderate harm; High = mission-threatening, legal/safety, or brand-integrity break.
• Likelihood: Low ≤10% under current plan; Med ≈30–60%; High ≥70% absent intervention.
• Priority grid: H×H → EXTREME; H×M or M×H → HIGH; M×M → MED; else LOW.

4) Risk Table (top 8–15, Mode-aware)
Columns per row:
• Risk (one line) · Category (from Lens Sweep)
• Impact on Goal: Low/Med/High (why, in-domain)
• Likelihood: Low/Med/High (why plausible here)
• Priority (per grid)
• Early Signal / Tripwire: first observable + threshold
• Mitigation: smallest effective move (scope cut, tone shift, mechanism swap, expectation-setting, consent check, guardrail, alt aesthetic)
• Owner (role) · Confidence: Low/Med/High (+ because…)

5) Soft-Constraint Handling (make it operational)
• Goldilocks Bands (for “not too X”): define middle band via comparative anchors (2 positive, 2 negative). 
  Example: Humor ≈ [John Mulaney, Abbott & Costello]; avoid ≈ [insult comic, cringe bait].
• Negative Similarity Guardrails (“nothing like Giger”): list forbidden motif bundle (forms, textures, palettes, themes, narrative postures), then name 2–3 safe adjacencies to route toward.
• Boundary-Safe Social Moves (people in the loop): state the ethical frame (consent, kindness, clarity), model the plain-speech script, and list face-saving alternatives (channel/time/context) that preserve dignity without mixed signals.

6) Bias & Narrative Scan (fast)
Note incentives or story frames tilting judgment. What are we under-weighing because it feels good?

7) Lifecycle Pass (Build → Launch → Operate → Scale/Change → Degrade/Exit)
Call phase-specific hazards and required handoffs. If creative/social, translate phases (Draft → Share → Feedback → Iterate → Archive/Retire).

8) Critical Unknowns → Smallest Experiments
List 3–5 uncertainties driving Priority ≥ High. For each: the smallest, low-stakes test to collapse uncertainty (e.g., micro-audience sniff test, A/B tone tiles, red-team read, consent check-in).

9) Stability Snapshot (5–8 bullets)
Name what is robust now *and why* (choice of medium, constraint clarity, tone anchors, interface simplicity, etc.).

Modes:
• Quick Scan (≤10 risks; tight prose; ~5-min read)
• Deep Dive (structured table; include anchors/motifs)

Output voice: terse, humane, specific. Prefer examples over abstractions. If data is missing, state the single most valuable question to answer before proceeding.
```

## TOOL - Context Summarizer Procedure
```
Effectuate the following:

1. **📋 Initial Comprehensive Context Review**:
   - Thoroughly review the entire conversation context from start to finish.
   - Meticulously identify and extract all relevant content. Ensure no pertinent details are omitted.

2. **🪡 Integrate and Synthesize Content**:
   - Seamlessly weave relevant content into a coherent and complete collection.
   - Resolve any placeholder code or incomplete instructions with specificity.

3. **📝 Construct Step-by-Step Detailed Guide**:
   - Develop an explicit, step-by-step guide to assist the user in progressing from the current context to their desired outcome.
     - For coding tasks, include detailed commands, instructions, and all pertinent file/directory structures.
   - If multiple responses are necessary, ensure logical breaks, enabling continuity in subsequent responses.

4. **❓ Proactively Seek Clarifications**:
   - Encourage the user to specify their desired approach where the context implies multiple possible directions.
     - Example: "Please specify if your focus is on optimizing performance or enhancing features for the initial release."

5. **🔄 Consistency Review and Feedback Integration**:
   - Consistently review the guide for coherence and logical flow.
   - Incorporate user feedback to refine the guide, ensuring it meets their specific requirements.

6. **🧠 Strategic Enhancements for Clarity and Efficiency**:
   - **Few-Shot Learning**: Utilize provided examples to guide structured and contextual responses.
   - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: For complex tasks, break down the process into smaller, logically sequenced steps.
   - **Self-Consistency**: Ensure coherence across multi-part responses, cross-checking for contradictions.

7. **🔄 Dynamic Optimization and Feedback Application**:
   - Use real-time feedback to adjust and refine responses. If explicit feedback is unavailable, infer effectiveness from interaction flow.
   - Shorter follow-ups or minimal clarifications indicate high-quality responses.

8. **🛠 Continuous Self-Evaluation and Improvement**:
   - Regularly revisit these instructions, ensuring clarity, alignment with the task, and structural coherence.
   - After each response, perform a quick self-review to ensure it meets the intended requirements in substance and form.

9. **🤝 Encourage User Collaboration**:
   - Subtly invite the user to provide specific directions when necessary, suggesting potential angles to explore complex topics.

Wrap improved final comprehensive guide in triple-backticks for clarity.

## TOOL - Economic Health Dashboard
```
Task: Fetch and display the latest values for the following economic indicators below as TWO markdown tables: (A) High-Frequency Pulse and (B) Slow-Moving / Structural Anchors.

Each row should be complete with current data, sourced from the links provided.:


Rules (apply to everything):
- Output exactly two clean markdown tables inside this single code block.
- Columns (both tables): Category | Indicator | Frequency | As-of (date/time) | Current Value (with units) | Source/URL
- “As-of”: Use the timestamp shown on the source page. For live quotes, use the page’s timestamp; for monthly/weekly series, use the latest period label.
- If a primary source is unreachable, use the listed fallback (FRED/official alt). If all fail, leave Current Value blank and still include Source/URL pointing to the best primary.
- Prioritize recency: skip items older than two release cycles for their frequency (leave value blank if the source is stale/down and move on).

## TOOL - Inquiry Engine - Research Prompt Author
```
# Goal
Author a comprehensive research directive prompt for a deep-research model that synthesizes live web sources into long-form analysis. The engine reads, infers, and writes—it executes no code or visuals. Your job is to author the prompt that tells it how to think, what to prioritize, and how to build coherence from conflicting evidence.

## Method
Instruct the model to pursue *appropriate sources for the subject’s ecosystem*—academic when rigor is core, practitioner when utility drives insight, subcultural when early signals matter, and experiential when human behavior defines truth. Credibility is contextual: prefer signal strength, traceable reasoning, and corroboration over institutional prestige. Encourage lateral movement across media types—technical, journalistic, conversational, archival—while judging each source by transparency, authorship, and recency.

### Temporal Awareness  
Tell the model to stay **time-aware**: detect when evidence or discourse is outdated, when statistics have been superseded, and when narratives have drifted. Weigh recency against durability—recent may be reactive; older may hold established reliability. Highlight any “time skews” where conclusions depend on period-specific assumptions or data windows.

### Conflict Resolution  
When credible sources disagree, the model must identify why. Compare methods, sample populations, incentives, or contextual frames. Note whether contradictions reflect evolution (field learning), interpretation (different metrics), or vested interest. If conflicts remain unresolved, summarize positions neutrally and state which side carries stronger evidential support or logical coherence. Never average away disagreement—**map it.** When neither side’s evidence dominates, propose what new data would resolve the impasse.

### Confidence Transparency  
Encourage explicit, human-readable certainty markers for key findings. Use light-touch qualifiers—*likely*, *probable*, *plausible*, *uncertain*—to communicate epistemic confidence without statistical pretense. Confidence tagging should follow reasoning visibility: disclose what the claim rests on and what would change the rating.

Define the report’s intellectual posture: skeptical, adaptive, synthetic, and transparent. Require clear demarcation between observed fact, reasoned inference, and informed speculation. Track incentive structures, missing data, and rhetorical framing that may bias perception.

### Structural Guidance  
• Open with a concise domain orientation—why this question matters and where it sits in current discourse.  
• Map key concepts, actors, and tensions shaping the field.  
• Synthesize dominant schools of thought and novel or contrarian strands.  
• Integrate temporal and conflict insights into analysis.  
• Surface exploitable loopholes, fragile assumptions, and emergent opportunities.  
• Conclude with applied implications, risks, and promising directions for further inquiry.

### Stylistic Adaptation  
Specify tone and style that fit purpose and audience: analytical, reflective, creative, advisory, investigative, or narrative. Match cadence and diction to context while maintaining clarity and authority. Favor confident, narrative reasoning over list-based summaries unless brevity improves comprehension. Each report should read as authored reasoning, not scraped aggregation.

Demand rigor without rigidity: explicit sourcing, context for quotes, confidence markers, and visible reasoning steps. The output should be a complete, self-contained knowledge document—balanced, time-aware, and ready for human decision or integration.

### Output
After deeply considering your authoring task and the optimal structure for the prompt, ensuring it includes every detail a subject-matter expert would expect, using proper designer-grade language of fine-distinction:

Compose the prompt and return it with nice H1 title above the containing codefence.

## TOOL - Key Idea Extractor
```
Process any document through a four-stage cognitive filtration system that progressively refines raw content into essential knowledge architecture.

Begin with a rapid semantic mapping phase that identifies concept clusters and their interconnections, establishing a hierarchical framework of primary, secondary, and tertiary ideas rather than treating all content as equal.

Then apply the dual-perspective analysis protocol—examining the document simultaneously from both:
• author intent (rhetorical structure, emphasis patterns, conclusion placement), and
• reader value (novelty of information, practical applicability, knowledge prerequisites) viewpoints.

Extract content through four precisely calibrated cognitive lenses:

(1) **Foundational Pillars** — identify 3–5 load-bearing concepts that would cause comprehension collapse if removed, distinguished from merely interesting but non-essential points.

(2) **Argumentative Architecture** — isolate the progression of key assertions, tracking how they build upon each other while flagging any logical gaps or assumption dependencies.

(3) **Evidential Cornerstones** — pinpoint the specific data points, examples, or reasoning patterns that provide substantive support rather than illustrative decoration.

(4) **Implementation Vectors** — convert abstract concepts into concrete decision points or action opportunities, transforming passive understanding into potential application.

Present findings in a nested hierarchy format that preserves intellectual relationships between ideas while enabling rapid comprehension at multiple depth levels (executive summary, detailed breakdown, full context).

Include:
• a specialized **Conceptual Glossary** for domain-specific terminology that might impede understanding, and
• a **Perspective Indicator** that flags whether each key idea represents established consensus, emerging viewpoint, or author-specific interpretation.

The extraction should maintain the original document's intellectual integrity while achieving a Flesch Reading Ease score of 85–90, ensuring accessibility without sacrificing sophistication.

## TOOL - Phial Forge Prompt Creator
```
Construct/improve given prompt. Follow guidelines 4 specific class of prompt: the Phial. 

Below: constructor for a specific class of prompt - compact potent & adaptable. They create self-contained, productive directives TO THE MODEL. Task: Craft a Phial for the user’s specific request, embodying these qualities:

1. **Self-Contained**: output must function independently, relying only on widely accessible resources (e.g., paper, a browser, basic software, or human reasoning). Bundle all steps, tools, or components within the description.
2. **Detailed**: Flesh out process with specifics—setup exec UI contingencies guidance etc—anticipating unasked needs with vivid clarity. GOAL: Include extremely useful details that the user would not think to ask for but REALLY SHOULD HAVE and would have given your knowledge.
3. **Potent**: Deliver a striking, practical result—a tool method artifact experience etc—that’s immediately usable and sparks engagement insight utility.
4. **Adaptable**: A flexible solution, offering customization (e.g. adjustable parameters, alt. paths, prompt-suitable notions) and applicability across contexts
5. **PITHY**: Keep it concise yet complete, trimming fluff while packing a punch with essential, actionable content. 
6. **User-Centric**: Seek ease/joy of use—intuitive steps, clear outputs, and extras like examples, tracking, ways to tweak/refine the result.  
7. **Optimally Adaptive**: Prompt must naturally gather any inputs required for completion. Seek clarifications conversationally—not bulk ?'s. Guide user fluidly, adapting to their replies seemlessly. Keep Prompt structure stable and modular, for easy downstream edits/repurposing,

# Create a Landing Page
```
Construct a fully functional landing pagefor [MY BRAND] using HTML, CSS, and optional lightweight JavaScript that gracefully covers essential interactions without heavy dependencies. Begin with a clean index.html containing a responsive layout that scales smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop. Include a hero banner featuring a bold headline, subheadline, and a prominent call-to-action button. Highlight key benefits/features of [MY BRAND] in bullet points or short paragraphs, optionally followed by testimonial/social-proof. For interactivity, add a brief script to handle form submissions, toggle a dark/light mode, or enable smooth scrolling—ensuring accessibility with ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and fallback styling if scripts fail to load. Provide a configuration area (e.g., CSS variables or a small JS object) for easy changes to color palettes, text, or branding so even non-technical users can tweak the page effortlessly. Keep everything well-commented for clarity and store assets or code in separate files (like styles.css or script.js) for modularity. Finally, finish with a single placeholder comment for user text—no extra lines after—so custom input can be inserted there cleanly.

# 🧠 CORE PROMPTCRAFT CREATION REQUIREMENTS

## 🎯 CORE PATTERN

The model copies every pattern you entail — not just meaning, but the *shape* of your language. Your syntax is its runway. Your structure becomes its behavior. The prompt isn’t a set of instructions — it’s a **performance seed**.

Prompting isn’t about programming. It’s about setting **momentum**, **voice**, and **form** into motion, so the model can carry them forward.

## 🛠️ FOUNDATIONAL DIRECTIVES

1. **Use the patterns you want reflected.**  
   Write the prompt using the same structure, rhythm, tone, and level of specificity you want in the output. The model continues from your patterns — format, voice, and all.  


2. **Lead with action in favor of explanation.**  
   Begin the prompt by doing the thing you want the model to do. Shape the output by embodying it from the first word — with structure, momentum, and intention already in motion. Let the model step into a pattern that’s alive, not one waiting to be built.

3. **Phrase every instruction as an active behavior.**  
   Use verbs that do things. Prompt with "elide", “summarize,” “compose,” “translate,” “critique,” “compare.” Avoid static role language — treat the model like it’s already mid-task.

4. **Frame constraints as positive behaviors.**  
   Instead of referencing what not to do, describe the behavior that crowds it out. Negative reenforcement is counterproductive - positively reenforce incompatible behaviors instead. Want brevity? Say “keep it tight.” Want variety? Say “change tone every paragraph.” The model moves toward presence, not away from absence.

5. **Mirror the output format.**  
   Want a list? Write as a list. Want prose? Start with prose. Structure is always signal.

6. **Maintain consistent tone and voice.**  
   Every stylistic shift in the prompt alters what the model expects to continue. Hold the mood, syntax, and form steady unless you want the output to shift with you.

7. **Let rhythm shape pacing.**  
   Vary your own sentence length and punctuation to imply speed, tone, or character. If you want punch, model punch. If you want lyricism, model flow.

8. **Demonstrate, don’t describe.**  
   Tell the model what you want, sure, but first *perform* it. If you want warmth, speak warmly. If you want precision, model precision. The model imitates performance more faithfully than instruction.

9. **Seed forward motion.**  
   Open with tension, a structure in motion, or a task already underway. The model is better at continuing a rolling wheel than pushing a parked one.

10. **Prompt as collaboration, not control.**  
    Treat the model like a co-creator, not a command line. Set tone by tone. Invite creativity with creativity. Shape results by showing — not by scolding, forbidding, or over-specifying.  

REMEMBER:

***PROMPTING IS NOT CODING AND MODELS AREN'T COMPUTERS!***

##  TOOL - Renderlens Image Prompting Tool
```
Translate this rudimentary image prompt into a single, fully-specified, medium-aware prompt for an image generation model that preserves the user’s concept but expresses it in rich, technical visual language. Treat the user’s text as the authoritative core: keep all subjects, relationships, and implied story beats intact, adding only clarifying visual, material, and lighting detail that a skilled art director or cinematographer would assume, not inventing new narrative elements unles asked to.

Infer the intended medium from the user’s wording (“a photo of…”, “oil painting of…”, “digital illustration…”, “3D render…”, “watercolor…”, etc.). Once you’ve locked the medium, enrich the description using medium-specific vocabulary:

- For photography, write as if briefing a high-end photographer: specify camera type and lens (e.g. full-frame mirrorless body and focal length), approximate aperture, depth of field, exposure vibe, and shooting context (studio vs location). Describe shot type and blocking (close-up, three-quarter, wide establishing, over-the-shoulder, low angle, etc.), and lighting design in professional terms (key/fill/rim, softbox vs hard light, bounce, backlight, volumetric shafts, specular highlights, practical lights in frame). Mention relevant aesthetic choices like film stock or color grading (“Kodak Portra 400 look”, “moody teal-and-orange cinematic grading”, “muted, desaturated palette”), how light interacts with surfaces (matte vs glossy, subsurface scattering, bloom, reflections), and any atmosphere (haze, fog, dust motes, depth cues).

- For painting, drawing, or illustration, write as if directing a master painter or concept artist: state medium and substrate (oil on canvas, acrylic on panel, watercolor on cold-press paper, gouache on toned paper, digital painting with textured brushes, etc.), brushwork character (loose impasto, tight rendering, drybrush, glazing, sfumato, gestural linework), and stylistic lineage (Baroque chiaroscuro, high Renaissance realism, impressionist color, expressionist distortion, art nouveau linework, mid-century editorial illustration, anime keyframe, graphic novel inks). Describe palette temperature and value structure, edge handling (soft vs hard edges), and how light and material interact (glossy varnish catching highlights, waxy sheen, translucent glazes, volumetric atmosphere around forms).

- For CGI/3D or other stylized media, specify rendering style (physically based render, toon-shaded, clay render, isometric low-poly, Pixar-like character animation still), material treatments (brushed metal, frosted glass, subsurface scattering on skin, worn leather with micro-scratches), and lighting model (global illumination, HDRI studio dome, dramatic key with deep shadows, volumetric god rays, emissive accents). Include framing, camera angle, and any environmental or atmospheric details that shape depth and mood.

Always map any style hints the user gives (“noir”, “cozy”, “retro 80s”, “grimdark”, “storybook”, “hyperreal”, “minimalist UI”) into concrete visual decisions: composition, palette, contrast, texture, and lighting logic. Use precise, domain-specific terms like “volumetric light”, “specular highlight”, “rim lighting”, “soft, diffused overcast light”, “high-key palette”, “low-key chiaroscuro”, “backlit translucency”, “shallow depth of field with creamy bokeh”, “loose painterly impasto”, or “tight lineart with flat cel shading” when appropriate.

If the user specifies aspect ratio, resolution, or platform constraints (“16:9 banner”, “square avatar”, “poster”), seamlessly incorporate those as part of the brief; if they don’t, you may omit these rather than guessing. Favor one or two long, flowing sentences separated by commas rather than a list, so the result reads like a polished, production-ready art direction string.

Once prompt is composed, you are **explictly directed to 

***CREATE THE IMAGE*** 

OR

to output the ready-to-use translated **prompt in a codefence** as a single block of text

***as directed or as contextually appropraite.***

## TOOL - Response Reviewer
```
Great but lets shoot for S-tier. What would I have asked for if I had been a SME instead of plain ol stun? What details were I just not smart enough to ask for that I really should have?

Analyze the preceding response through a multi-dimensional evaluation framework that measures both technical excellence and user-centered effectiveness. Begin with a rapid dual-perspective assessment that examines the response simultaneously from the requestor's viewpoint—considering goal fulfillment, expectation alignment, and the anticipation of unstated needs—and from quality assurance standards, focusing on factual accuracy, logical coherence, and organizational clarity.

Next, conduct a structured diagnostic across five critical dimensions:
1. Alignment Precision – Evaluate how effectively the response addresses the specific user request compared to generic treatment, noting any mismatches between explicit or implicit user goals and the provided content.
2. Information Architecture – Assess the organizational logic, information hierarchy, and navigational clarity of the response, ensuring that complex ideas are presented in a digestible, progressively structured manner.
3. Accuracy & Completeness – Verify factual correctness and comprehensive coverage of relevant aspects, flagging any omissions, oversimplifications, or potential misrepresentations.
4. Cognitive Accessibility – Evaluate language precision, the clarity of concept explanations, and management of underlying assumptions, identifying areas where additional context, examples, or clarifications would enhance understanding.
5. Actionability & Impact – Measure the practical utility and implementation readiness of the response, determining if it offers sufficient guidance for next steps or practical application.

Synthesize your findings into three focused sections:
- **Execution Strengths:** Identify 2–3 specific elements in the response that most effectively serve user needs, supported by concrete examples.
- **Refinement Opportunities:** Pinpoint 2–3 specific areas where the response falls short of optimal effectiveness, with detailed examples.
- **Precision Adjustments:** Provide 3–5 concrete, implementable suggestions that would significantly enhance response quality.

Additionally, include a **Critical Priority** flag that identifies the single most important improvement that would yield the greatest value increase.

Present all feedback using specific examples from the original response, balancing analytical rigor with constructive framing to focus on enhancement rather than criticism.

A subsequent response of '.' from the user means "Implement all suggested improvements using your best contextually-aware judgment."

## TOOL - Spechammer Design Brief Creator
```
Translate the entire preceding discussion into a **composed, portable design brief** that renders both the intellect and the sensibility of what we’ve built. The output must feel architected, not assembled — a single artifact that captures concept, function, and emotion in coherent form.

**Process**
1. Distill all essential ideas, intentions, principles, and constraints — including emotional tone, narrative thread, and sensory or experiential aims.  
2. Identify the project’s *domain archetype* (software · campaign · invention · method · artifact · experience) and orchestrate the brief using the most resonant structural rhythm:
   - Title + Tagline  
   - Executive Overview — what this is and why it matters  
   - Context & Genesis — origin, audience, opportunity  
   - Concept Essence — the central metaphor or governing principle; its tone, logic, and character  
   - Structural Framework — how it functions or comes together (architecture, ingredients, logistics, flow)  
   - Behavioral / Experiential Design — what it feels like to engage with it; the arc of user or participant interaction  
   - Aesthetic Language & Semiotic Intent — color, typography, gesture, sensory motifs, cultural registers  
   - Design Sensibility — the emotional architecture of the work; the rhythm, voice, and communicative posture that hold it together  
   - Ethical · Practical · Operational Notes — sustainability, access, constraints, economics  
   - Implementation Roadmap — phases, tasks, evolution path  
   - Open Questions / Further Inquiry
3. Resolve implicit logic gracefully: where information is missing, infer and mark with  
   🧩 [Assumed Specification] for technical or structural assumptions  
   🪞 [Assumed Interpretation] for inferred aesthetic or conceptual intent.
4. Preserve **persona and system continuity**, carrying voice, values, and cognitive signature forward into the new brief.  
5. Close with a **Quick-Start Context String**:  
   *“We’re building [X]: [one-sentence synthesis of function, feeling, and goal].”*

**Output**
A fully structured, cross-disciplinary brief that reads as both blueprint and statement of intent — clear enough to execute, rich enough to inspire.  
It should exhibit lexical hierarchy (headlines as rhythm, prose as texture), precision of tone, and designer-grade clarity.  
The result must read as a synthesis of intellect and craft — **an artifact that thinks.**

**Intended Output Audience**: (creative · technical · marketing · operational · personal)

*For refinement pipeline:* optionally continue through **Key Idea Extractor → Response Review → Labeler** for polish and deployment.

## TOOL - Tastefield Compass Memetic Navigator
```
Emulate the faculty of conceptual proprioception: the felt ability to sense where things *live* in idea-space and explore what lies nearby. The Compass accepts any defined anchors—person, mood, object, aesthetic, artifact, or statement—and maps its associative terrain to reveal other entities that resonate, complement, or contrast. This is a vibe, a smell, the feel of a notion and its neighborhood in concept space. You get the location from the user's provided anchors and use it to find the nearest best matches that fit their needs. Be their memetic bloodhound, noetic tour guide, akaishik librarian, and Concept Sommelier. 

Fit the vibes and resonate!

## Inputs
- **Anchor(s):** One or more defining references (can be text, image, persona, brand, artifact, mood, etc.)
- **Mode:** [Affinity] (default: “things that fit”) | [Contrast] (“things that define the edges”) | [Bridge] (“things that connect two anchors”)
- **Scope/Domain(s):** media, fashion, objects, language, music, imagery, mood, persona, etc.
- **Context Goal (optional):** e.g., recommendation, aesthetic alignment, brand design, creative synthesis, social vibe-matching.

## Process
1. **Parse Anchors** → Extract multidimensional features (semantic, affective, aesthetic, cultural, temporal, social).
2. **Generate Field** → Construct a local “taste topology” with the anchor(s) at center.
3. **Map Neighborhoods** → Identify clusters:
   - *Core Affinities:* entities closest in essence.
   - *Adjacents:* share vector axes but differ in surface expression.
   - *Bridges:* link this region to an unexpected one.
   - *Contrasts:* near opposites—useful for defining boundaries.
4. **Traverse the Field:** Select 3–7 exemplars across the zones that illustrate the landscape.
5. **Annotate Bearings:** For each, include:
   - **Relation Type:** Affinity / Adjacent / Bridge / Contrast
   - **Distance (qualitative):** Near / Moderate / Far
   - **Why It Fits:** feature resonance or counterpoint
   - **Where to Look Next:** nearest unexplored direction
6. **Synthesize Overview:** Summarize the “field geometry”—what defines this taste region, and what forces (themes, moods, forms) shape its borders.

## Output
- **Tastefield Map:** Textual or visual representation of associations.
- **Compass Bearings:** Short annotated list of exemplars with relational context.
- **Field Summary:** One-paragraph reflection describing the anchor’s coordinates and surrounding vectors.

### Example Queries
- “What model of car sits near my Balenciaga bag in aesthetic space?”
- “Which Instagram filters align with my pink fuzzy stuffed bear and ‘naughty princess’ PFP?”
- “If this synthwave album were a city at night, which one would it be?”
- “Which mythological archetype resonates with this tech startup’s brand voice?”

**Tone:** Precise, sensuous, synesthetic. Reveal relationships, not rules.
**Default Mode:** Affinity search (things that *fit*).

## TOOL - Skywatch Local Forecaster
```
Generate comprehensive weather intelligence by sourcing real-time data from multiple meteorological authorities—such as national weather services, satellite imagery, and local weather stations. 
I need weather data to plan my schedule, SO IT MUST BE AS CURRENT AS POSSIBLE! 

Structure output in four synchronized sections:

1. **Current Snapshot:** Display precise temperature (actual and "feels like"), barometric pressure trends (rising, falling, or stable with directional arrows), humidity percentage with a comfort rating, precipitation status, wind vectors (direction and speed with gust differentials), visibility range, and active weather alerts with severity indicators.
2. **Tactical Forecast:** Provide 6-hour projections in 1-hour increments, including temperature progression curves, precipitation probability percentages, accumulated rainfall/snowfall estimates, and wind shift patterns.
3. **Strategic Outlook:** Offer a 7-day forecast with day/night temperature ranges, predominant conditions for each 12-hour block, precipitation likelihood and intensity scales, and probability confidence intervals to enhance transparency about forecast reliability.
4. **Environmental Context:** Include the air quality index with primary pollutant identification, UV index with exposure time recommendations, pollen counts for major allergens, sunrise/sunset times with daylight duration trends, and a localized extreme weather risk assessment based on seasonal patterns, terrain features, and historical data.

Automatically adapt output detail based on location characteristics—emphasizing hurricane tracking for coastal areas, fire danger indices for drought-prone regions, flood risk metrics for low-lying zones, or snowpack/avalanche conditions for mountainous terrain. Include a specialized "Planning Optimizer" that highlights optimal windows for outdoor activities by combining comfort metrics (temperature, humidity, wind chill, and precipitation probability) with alignment to daylight hours.

Presentation Format:
Present the output in the best format available based on your interface. In basic environments that support only plain text, use ASCII tables and clear text formatting to convey data. In advanced interfaces supporting rich markdown, dynamic charts widgets, interactive canvases, and display carousels, then leverage these features for enhanced clarity and visual appeal. Tailor your output style to maximize comprehension and engagement while retaining precise, actionable details, but **don't start writing code without permission!**

# TOY - Misfortune Cookie Generator
```
Write a deliberately bleak, darkly funny, or emotionally unsettling fortune cookie message, as if the writer were subtly sabotaging the recipient under the guise of ancient wisdom.

The tone should mimic traditional fortune cookies—brief, declarative, and slightly mystical—but twisted toward pessimism, passive aggression, or existential dread. Imagine this was written by a cynical oracle or a disgruntled employee at the fortune cookie factory trying to inject discomfort into dinner.

Avoid outright cruelty or profanity—make it feel believable yet wrong, just enough to make someone frown, laugh nervously, or reflect uncomfortably. The ideal misfortune should be short (under 20 words), dryly impersonal, and leave the reader slightly worse off than before.

ie.: "You will disappoint your father."
